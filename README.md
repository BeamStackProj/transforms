## Detailed Overview of Beamstack PTransform Components

### 1. Embedding Transforms

The embedding transforms are designed to facilitate the creation of vector representations for text data. These transforms support various embedding models including those from Hugging Face and OpenAI. They are highly customizable and can be integrated into larger NLP pipelines for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more.

### 2. Web Scraping Transforms

Beamstack provides a set of transforms specifically for web scraping. These transforms allow you to extract, clean, and preprocess data from websites, making it ready for downstream tasks like text analysis or machine learning.

### 3. Elasticsearch Vector Store Transforms

This component allows for the creation and management of Elasticsearch vector stores directly within your Beam pipelines. You can efficiently index and search for high-dimensional vectors, enabling tasks such as semantic search and nearest neighbor retrieval.

### 4. ML Inference Transforms

With ML Inference Transforms, you can seamlessly run machine learning models within your Apache Beam pipelines. This component supports popular ML frameworks and provides utilities for handling model inputs and outputs in a distributed manner.
